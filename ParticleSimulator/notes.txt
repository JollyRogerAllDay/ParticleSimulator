Neural network that is able to tweak the swarms parameters and think.

Set an optimization goal for the neural network. Based on the amount of time it takes
to solve the optimization, as well as additional factors (any ants died, reproduced...)

Include Reproduction Rates!!! Death and birth of ants

| General ACO Algorithm |
1. Set Parameters
2. Initialize pheromone
3. Start epoch
	- update position
	- update pheromone

[Finished]:
	- Ants appear in grid

[To Do]: 
	- [High]implement algorithm to start iteration 
	- [Med]ability to click and set the target
	
--2017.07.13--

[Finished]:
	- Controls to start and pause the drawing. Only randomizes position right now

[To Do]: 
	- [High]implement algorithm to start iteration 
	- [Med]ability to click and set the target
	- [Med] implement pheromone trail
	- [low] Output anys position to output

[Questions]:
	- Does it make more sense for the World to know the population original position or the population?
	
--2017.07.16--

[Finished]:
	- Can manually set target
	- Worked on pheromone update. Depedant on target. Work on updating position next
